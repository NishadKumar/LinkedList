# LinkedList
Contains program performing all operations on a linkedlist.(insert,delete,search,append,fetch nth node, fetch nth node from last,reverse the list)
New commit - Added a method to detect loops if any in a linked list.
New commit - Added a method to count a particular data's occurences in the linked list. 
New commit - Added a method to delete a node at a given position.
New commit - Added a method that reverses a linked list
**Given only a pointer/reference to a node to be deleted in a singly linked list, how do you delete it?(Question from GeeksForGeeks)**
New commit - Added a method where, given a pointer to a node, that node has to be deleted. Note: With the idea of taking list's header to traverse to the given pointer and then deleting it would destroy the purpose of the question and would take longer time. Easiest solution is to copy the node_ptr-->next.data to node_ptr.data and remove the node_ptr.next node.
New commit - Added a method that prints the linkedlist in reverse using recursion.
New commit - Added a method that removes duplicates if any present from a linked list.
