# LinkedList
Contains program performing all operations on a linkedlist.(insert,delete,search,append,fetch nth node, fetch nth node from last,reverse the list)
New commit - Added a method to detect loops if any in a linked list.
New commit - Added a method to count a particular data's occurences in the linked list. 
New commit - Added a method to delete a node at a given position.
New commit - Added a method that reverses a linked list
New commit - Added a method where, given a node pointer, that node has to be deleted. Note: Using header would take longer time. Easiest solution is to copy the node_ptr-->next.data to node_ptr.data and remove the node_ptr.next node.
